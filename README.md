I'm Alexey Popodko â€” a technically-minded professional with a background in physics, hands-on coding experience, and a strong interest in data, research and machine learning, recently began my journey in Data Science Field.

I'm currently working as a medical physicist at a hospital in Moscow, where Iâ€™m involved in radiation treatment planning, quality assurance for linear accelerators, and integrating modern research into clinical practice. My work also includes research activities â€” from publishing articles to exploring new methods â€” where I use Python for data analysis and automation. 

Recently graduated from Yandex Practicumâ€™s Data Science training program, where I developed a variety of data science projects. I'm always open to learning, collaborating, and contributing to meaningful challenges.

### Background in Research
With 6+ years of scientific research experience, Iâ€™ve contributed to projects involving brain-computer interfaces, EEG signal processing, and applied medical physics / radiotherapy. These works have been published and presented at scientific conferences.  I also participate in lectures and technical training at Lomonosov MSU.
