I'm Alexey Popodko — a technically-minded professional with a background in physics, hands-on coding experience, and a strong interest in data, research, and machine learning

I'm currently working as a medical physicist at a hospital in Moscow, where I’m involved in radiation treatment planning, quality assurance for linear accelerators, and integrating modern research into clinical practice. My work also includes research activities — from publishing articles to exploring new methods — where I use Python for modeling, data analysis, and automation. 

Recently graduated from Yandex Practicum’s Data Science training program, where I developed a variety of data science projects. I'm always open to learning, collaborating, and contributing to meaningful challenges.
