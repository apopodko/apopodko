I'm Alexey Popodko â€” a technically-minded professional with a background in physics, hands-on coding experience, and a strong interest in data, research, and machine learning

I'm currently working as a medical physicist at a hospital in Moscow, where Iâ€™m involved in radiation treatment planning, quality assurance for linear accelerators, and integrating modern research into clinical practice. My work also includes research activities â€” from publishing articles to exploring new methods â€” where I use Python for modeling, data analysis, and automation.


### ðŸ’¡ Interests & Focus Areas
I enjoy working on problems at the intersection of science and technology. My current interests include:

Data analysis and modeling using Python and SQL

Machine learning (classification, NLP, optimization)

Working with complex signals and data (EEG, MRI, medical tech)

Exploring real-world applications of ML in healthcare and science

### ðŸ“š Background in Research & Education
With several years of research experience, Iâ€™ve contributed to projects involving brain-computer interfaces, EEG signal processing, and applied physics. My work has been published and presented at conferences. I also participate in lectures and technical training.


### ðŸ“‚ On This GitHub
Here you'll find a mix of hands-on projects, experiments, and course work â€” including ML models, EDA notebooks, and tools Iâ€™ve built while studying and exploring data science and machine learning techniques.

Currently graduated from Yandex Practicum training courses where I was developing variety of Data Science projects. Always open to learning, collaborating, and contributing to meaningful challenges.
